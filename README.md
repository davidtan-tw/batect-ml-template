# batect-ml-template

A template for ML projects, with dependency management made effortless by `batect`

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- Java 8 or newer (used by batect. you'll not be seeing Java code - I promise)
- On Linux and macOS: `bash` and `curl`
- On Windows: Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016 or later

## Setup

Install the dependencies needed by `batect` on your host machine
```shell script
# mac users
bin/non_batect/go.sh

# windows / linux
# work in progress. in the meantime, please install Docker and Java manually if it's not already installed
```
